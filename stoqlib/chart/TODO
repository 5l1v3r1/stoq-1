Stoq integration:
* Require twisted & webkit in debian/dependencies

* Cleanup tcp port allocation, allow several stoq to run at the same time
* Use new template module for reports

Misc:
* Write a few more reports
* Design chart arguments properly
* Copy jquery/flot into stoq
* move css to a file, to reduce html size
* Consider AJAX for quering chart data

Tests:
* Reporting really needs to be tested properly
* Easy to test, pre-define html files, assume html renders fine for now

Reports:
* Prettify, look at others for nice styles (colors, borders etc)
