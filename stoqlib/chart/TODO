  * Per account/group
* Stock
  * Total value over time
* Check with Async's budget to see what's needed
* Ask some customers what the need

UI:
* Finish ReportDialog
  * Mostly basic ui
  * Preview?
* Write a proper chart viewer widget
  * Refresh button?
  * Copy URL menu popup + link
* Figure out printing

Stoq integration:
* Require twisted & webkit in debian/dependencies
* Change gtk.main() to use reactor.run()
* Cleanup tcp port allocation, allow several stoq to run at the same time
* Use new template module for reports

Misc:
* Design chart arguments properly
* Copy jquery/flot into stoq
* move css to a file, to reduce html size
* Consider AJAX for quering chart data
* Chart overlays? Esp. interesting for specific time intervals

Tests:
* Reporting really needs to be tested properly
* Easy to test, pre-define html files, assume html renders fine for now

Reports:
* Prettify, look at others for nice styles (colors, borders etc)
